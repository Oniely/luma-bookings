				Jane, a busy business traveler, opens the hotel app on her smartphone. She inputs New York City as her destination, selects check-in and check-out dates, and filters for hotels with high guest ratings and in the downtown area. Jane browses the search results, taps on a hotel to view detailed room information, and proceeds to book a deluxe room. The app guides her through the secure payment process, and she receives an instant confirmation with all the reservation details. Jane later accesses her account to review the itinerary and prepare for her upcoming trip.
